`yc` is the command-line interface (CLI) tool for deploying your serverless functions on Vivgrid. 
It provides a convenient way to manage your deployments and serverless instances globally.

## Installation

To install `yc`, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl "https://bina.egoist.dev/vivgrid/yc" | sh
```

## Usage

`yc --help` to see all sub-commands.

General Options:

- `--app-key`: The application key of your Vivgrid project.
- `--app-secret`: The application secret of your Vivgrid project.
- `--sfn-name`: The name of your serverless function calling service.
- `--zipper`: The URL of the Vivgrid Zipper Service endpoint, the default value is `zipper.vivgrid.com`.
- `--env`: The environment variables for your serverless function. you can pass multiple `--env` options like `yc deploy app.go --env OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=token --env GITHUB_API_KEY=token`.

You can create a `yc.yml` file in the root of your project to configure the deployment settings instead of passing the options every time.

### yc deploy [FILE]...

This command will deploy your serverless function to Vivgrid hosting.

```bash
yc deploy app.go --env KEY=VALUE
```

### Manage serverless deployment

Your serverless code will be uploaded to Vivgrid and compiled by `yc upload` command, after that, you can create the deployments by `yc create` command.

#### yc upload

This command will compile your serverless function after uploading to Vivgrid hosting.

```bash
yc upload app.go
```

#### yc create

This command will create the deployments.

```bash
yc create
```

#### yc remove

This command will delete the deployments.

```bash
yc remove
```

### Manage serverless state

Once the deployment is created, you can manage the state of the deployments. `yc start` will start the serverless on all regions. Requests will be routed to the nearest region by Vivgrid Geo-distributed Network.

#### yc status

This command will show the status of the deployments.

```bash
yc status
```

#### yc start

This command will start serverless instances in all regions.

```bash
yc start
```

```bash

#### yc logs

This command will show the real-time logs of serverless instances across all regions.

```bash
yc logs
```

Terminate the logs by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

## `yc.yml` Configuration File

You can create a `yc.yml` file in the root of your project to configure the deployment settings.

```yaml
zipper: zipper.vivgrid.com
app-key: <APP_KEY>
app-secret: <APP_SECRET>
sfn-name: your_function_name
```

- `zipper`: The URL of the Vivgrid Zipper Service endpoint, the default value is `zipper.vivgrid.com`.
- `app-key`: The application key of your Vivgrid project.
- `app-secret`: The application secret of your Vivgrid project.
- `sfn-name`: The name of your serverless function calling service.
